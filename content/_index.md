# What is 508.dev?
We are a US-registered LLC that provides general software engineering services, consultation, and project-based development. In particular, our team has a lot of experience in developing accessible web applications. We're based in Taiwan, and have a greater goal of exposing the highly skilled talent here in Taiwan to the global market.

# What can the 508.dev team do for me?
Depends on your needs, which, by the way, we can help you figure out.

Here's some things we *have* done:

* Upgrade existing web applications to bring them up to [WCAG-AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards
* Consult with frontend teams on accessible programming strategies and accessible testing strategies
* Build fullstack applications in the healthcare, finance, and game industries, which happen to meet high web accessibility standards
* Perform [VPATs](https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/), followed by assisting product managers in ticketing, estimating, and prioritizing accessibility bugs

# I don't know what Web Accessibility is, or why I should care.

Web accessibility means making your websites and applications easy, or even just possible, for all people to use. A common misconception is that accessible web engineering means making it so screen readers can function on the page thus allowing blind users to use the application, but in fact an accessible web application is one that is also easy to use for:

* Everyone's grandparents (75% of people age 65+ use the internet, or in the USA about 42 million people), for example ensuring text is big enough and high contrast enough to be readable,
* People using the internet on their phone (68% of all internet traffic), for example ensuring that buttons are large enough and far enough apart to be individually pushed, that text renders at a proper size on mobile devices, or ensuring that no content is hidden on certain device widths
* People who take a little longer to do things on their devices, so for example ensuring that forms don't have time limits, that text doesn't arbitrarily and unexpectedly change, etc

Of course, having an accessible web application also means that users with disabilities can use your application, which is not only ethical, it also can increase your bottom line: estimates are as high as [7 milllion people in the USA using screen readers](https://nfb.org/resources/blindness-statistics). Also, if your website is inaccessible, you might get sued, like one of the [2,058 companies in 2020](https://www.accessibility.com/complete-report-2020-website-accessibility-lawsuits) did.

# Is your team competent?

Yes.

[Caleb](https://calebjay.com/resume.html) is a software engineer out of San Francisco with 6 years of experience developing applications for companies like Google, Curative, Humcapital, Potato, and Twilio. See the resume link for more info.

Other teammembers resumes pending, we have been fortunate in our search for project work and so none of us have had much time to update our personal sites!

# With what technologies are you familiar?

* Javascript / Node / Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS
* All major web frameworks, including React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and even Backbone
* Most major backend frameworks, including Django, Express, FastAPI, Sails.js, and Flask
* Testing software such as Jest, pytest, Selenium, Cypress, Mocha, Chai, and Jasmine
* Bundling software such as Webpack, Rollup, Grunt, Gulp, and Make
* Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud (GCP), and Azure
* Github, Gitlab, Trello, Linear, Asana, Podio, Jira
* Docker

# Do you only do Web Accessibility contracts?

Actually, most of our jobs are full webapp projects. We just really care about accessibility :)

# What don't you know?

None of us have ever touched Laravel, Ember, or ASP .NET. If you have a project like this, we can still recommend accessible web engineering strategies, perform a VPAT, or offer general consultation, but we would probably recommend another team if you need actual development work done.

# How do you bill?

We've done project-based and hourly and are comfortable with whatever best meets your needs.

# What's your values?

Caleb moved to Taiwan from San Francisco and found the engineers he was meeting in his new home to be ridiculously skilled considering the somewhat stale job market in Taiwan. Other than improving web accessibility wherever possible, we're interested in internationalizing the Taiwan engineering talent pool. For our clients, it means they get Bay Area-level engineering at a discount, for 508, it means we get to build out Silicon Valley engineering mindsets here in Taiwan, with the goal of eventually converting to a product company. To that end, even if you aren't interested in hiring a full engineering team, send Caleb an email anyway, he may be able to put you in touch with an excellent engineer in Taiwan.
