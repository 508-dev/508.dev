# What is 508.dev?
We are a US-registered LLC that provides general software engineering services, consultation, and project-based development. In particular, our team has a lot of experience in developing accessible web applications.

# How can I contact you?

Email caleb@508.dev

# What can the 508.dev team do for me?
Depends on your needs, which, by the way, we can help you figure out.

Here's some things we *have* done:

* Upgrade existing web applications to bring them up to [WCAG-AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards
* Consult with frontend teams on accessible programming strategies and accessible testing strategies
* Build fullstack applications in the healthcare, finance, and game industries, which happen to meet high web accessibility standards
* Perform [VPATs](https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/), followed by assisting product managers in ticketing, estimating, and prioritizing accessibility bugs

# I don't know what Web Accessibility is, or why I should care.

Web accessibility means making your websites and applications easy, or even just possible, for all people to use. A common misconception is that accessible web engineering means making it so screen readers can function on the page thus allowing blind users to use the application, but in fact an accessible web application is one that is also easy to use for:

* Everyone's grandparents (75% of people age 65+ use the internet, or in the USA about 42 million people), for example ensuring text is big enough and high contrast enough to be readable,
* People using the internet on their phone (68% of all internet traffic), for example ensuring that buttons are large enough and far enough apart to be individually pushed, that text renders at a proper size on mobile devices, or ensuring that no content is hidden on certain device widths
* People who take a little longer to do things on their devices, so for example ensuring that forms don't have time limits, that text doesn't arbitrarily and unexpectedly change, etc

Of course, having an accessible web application also means that users with disabilities can use your application, which is not only ethical, it also can increase your bottom line: estimates are as high as [7 milllion people in the USA using screen readers](https://nfb.org/resources/blindness-statistics). Also, if your website is inaccessible, you might get sued, like one of the [2,058 companies in 2020](https://www.accessibility.com/complete-report-2020-website-accessibility-lawsuits) did.

# Is your team competent?

Yes.

[Caleb](https://calebjay.com/resume.html) is a software engineer out of San Francisco with 6 years of experience developing applications for companies like Google, Curative, Humcapital, Potato, and Twilio. See the resume link for more info.

Other teammembers are still updating their personal websites to be presentable on this page, which would be surprising until one learns that top chefs eat McDonald's after work.

# With what technologies are you familiar?

* Javascript / Node / Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS
* All major web frameworks, including React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and even Backbone
* Most major backend frameworks, including Django, Express, FastAPI, Sails.js, and Flask
* Testing software such as Jest, pytest, Selenium, Cypress, Mocha, Chai, and Jasmine
* Bundling software such as Webpack, Rollup, Grunt, Gulp, and Make
* Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud (GCP), and Azure
* Github, Gitlab, Trello, Linear, Asana, Podio, Jira
* Docker


# What don't you know?

None of us have ever touched Laravel, Ember, or ASP .NET. If you have a project like this, we can still recommend accessible web engineering strategies, perform a VPAT, or offer general consultation, but we would probably recommend another team if you need actual development work done.

# How do you bill?

We've done project-based and hourly and are comfortable with whatever best meets your needs.
