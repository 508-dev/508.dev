Other teammembers resumes are pending, we have been fortunate in our search for project work and so none of us have had much time to update our personal sites!

# Incapabilities?

None of us have ever touched Laravel, Ember, or ASP .NET. If you have a project like this, we can still recommend accessible web engineering strategies, perform a VPAT, or offer general consultation, but we would probably recommend another team if you need actual development work done.

# Billing?

We've done, and are comfortable with any of the following:

* Project based
* Hourly / Consultation
* Maintenance


# Values?

Caleb moved to Taiwan from San Francisco and found the engineers he was meeting in his new home to be ridiculously skilled considering the somewhat stale job market in Taiwan. Other than improving web accessibility wherever possible, we're interested in internationalizing the Taiwan engineering talent pool. For our clients, it means they get Bay Area-level engineering at a discount, for 508, it means we get to build out Silicon Valley engineering mindsets here in Taiwan, with the goal of eventually converting to a product company. To that end, even if you aren't interested in hiring a full engineering team, send Caleb an email anyway, he may be able to put you in touch with an excellent engineer in Taiwan.
